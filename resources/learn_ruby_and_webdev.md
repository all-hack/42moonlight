## Learning Track for Ruby & Web Development

Prerequisites: Command Line, Git, and Github knowledge (42 students should be fine)

I recommend to do these in order. It's important to understand Ruby fundamentals before diving into web dev frameworks.

### Ruby

1. Complete Codecademy [Ruby Track](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/ruby)
2. Do all exercises in [Learn to Program](http://files.meetup.com/8441952/Learn%20to%20Program,%202nd%20Edition.pdf), by Chris Pine
	- (Optional) Do exercises in LaunchSchool's [Ruby Book](https://launchschool.com/books/ruby/)
3. Complete the following projects, and get feedback on each of them. For feedback, send [me](https://github.com/MatiasFMolinari) a link to your github repo through Slack.
	- Create tic-tac-toe game in the terminal, without OOP.
	- Create rock paper scissors game in the terminal, without OOP.
	- (Optional) Create blackjack game in the terminal, without OOP.
4. Read up on [Object Oriented Programing](https://launchschool.com/books/oo_ruby).
5. Complete the following projects, and get feedback on each of them. For feedback, send [me](https://github.com/MatiasFMolinari) a link to your github repo through Slack.
	- Create a simple tic-tac-toe game in the terminal, with OOP.
	- Create a simple rock paper scissors game in the terminal, with OOP.
	- (Optional) Create blackjack game in the terminal, with OOP.
5. Complete at least 6 Ruby exercises on [exercism.io](http://exercism.io/). You should have multiple iterations on each exercise based on the feedback recieved. At this point, the Ruby API should be bookmarked in your browser and you should be visiting it A LOT.

### Web Dev

1. Read up on [HTTP](https://launchschool.com/books/http).
2. Read up on [SQL](https://launchschool.com/books/sql).
3. Convert one of your Ruby projects (tic-tac-toe, RPS, or blackjack) into a Sinatra app.
	- To learn Sintra, read the [docs](http://www.sinatrarb.com/intro.html) or [Jump Start Sinatra](http://dl.finebook.ir/book/29/11148.pdf). But don't dive too deep, you just need the basics.
	- Simple example Sinatra app: [Example App](https://github.com/MatiasFMolinari/blackjack-webapp)
4. Read up on Rails. Start with Michael Hartl's [book](https://www.railstutorial.org/book).
5. Make a simple Reddit clone in Rails. Make sure to visit the API repeatedly.
	- Should include Users, Posts, Comments, Upvotes/Downvotes, and PostgreSQL Database.
	- Should be deployed to Heroku.
6. Make a small personal project with Rails. Make sure it's a small project, don't go overboard.

**Tips:** The Ruby API and the Rails API (also known as the Docs) are your friend. Visit them repeatedly. Also, after each project, look for feedback. Anyone with some experience in Ruby will do. You can always send your projects to me, @mfernand, through Slack.

Happy Coding! :smile:
